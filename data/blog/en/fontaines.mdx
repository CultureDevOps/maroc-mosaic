Fountains, true works of art, often combine utility and aesthetics. Carved from stone, marble, or adorned with mosaics, they have decorated gardens, squares, and courtyards since antiquity. Symbols of life and freshness, they were at the heart of Roman cities, irrigating baths and prestigious villas. 
In the East, they embody elegance and serenity, especially in riads and palaces where water murmurs at the center of patios. From monumental basins to wall fountains, they are a timeless testament to the union of art and engineering, telling the story of civilizations through their shapes and decorations.
